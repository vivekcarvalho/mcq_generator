      "Background: “Triple whammy” (TW) refers to the simultaneous use of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To date, the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) associated to this combination has not been deeply investigated. The objectives are to analyze the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” including all NSAIDs versus non-exposure to this combination. Secondarily, the risk of hospitalization, severe adverse events, requirement of renal replacement therapy and mortality will be assessed. Also, the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” versus non-exposure will be analyzed, including only metamizole as NSAID.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Methods: A systematic literature search of intervention studies and analytical observational studies will be conducted in the Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE, among others. AKI 12 months after the last prescription of the triple combination will be the main outcome. Relative frequencies, risk of bias and certainty of evidence will be analyzed. Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Results: Once this systematic review has been completed, the results are expected to provide an estimate of the risk associated with this triple combination and the renal variables, in addition to new guidance on the renal treatment of patients potentially receiving triple therapy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions: This is intended to be the first systematic review of observational studies to analyse TW combination and AKI's risk based on well-validated epidemiological databases exploring drug safety issues.\n",

It tests basic knowledge of medication categories.\\n* **Question 2:**  This question is clear and straightforward. It assesses understanding of the research focus.\\n* **Question 3:** This question is slightly more challenging, requiring knowledge of different study types. \\n* **Question 4:** This question is conceptually sound but could be worded more concisely. \\n* **Question 5:**  This question is well-structured and assesses specific detail from the research context.\\n* **Question 6:**  This question is appropriate and tests understanding of the expected outcomes of a systematic review.\\n\\n**Improvements:**\\n\\n* **Question 4:**  Instead of \"primary goal,\" consider replacing it with \"main objective\" for clarity. \\n* **General:**  The quiz could benefit from a more consistent tone and structure. Consider a more direct and concise phrasing for each question.\\n\\n**Updated Quiz Questions:**\\n\\n**1:** What combination of drugs is referred to as the \"triple whammy\" in medicine?\\n**2:** What is the primary focus of this systematic review?\\n**3:** Which types of studies will be included in this systematic review?\\n**4:** What is the main objective of this systematic review?\\n**5:** Which NSAID is being analyzed separately in this review?\\n**6:** What is the anticipated outcome of this systematic review? \\n\\n**Tone:** The updated questions are more direct and concise, aligning with the expected cognitive abilities of Triple Whammy students.
